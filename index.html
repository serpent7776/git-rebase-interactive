# git rebase --interactive

---

# rebase
Reapply local commits on top of other branch. Sometimes referred to as history rewriting/editing, but it doesn't really edit commits, it creates a new fork in the history.

```
                     A---B---C  topic
                    /
               D---E---F---G  master
```
```sh
git rebase master
```
```
                     A---B---C
                    /
               D---E---F---G  master
                            \
                             A'--B'--C'  topic
```

# rebase --interactive

`rebase` always reapplies commits as they are. `rebase --interactive` lets you customise what is to be done.

Some possible commands:
  - fixup commits
  - change commit message
  - remove commit
  - reorder commits
  - execute an external command
  - split commits

---

# commit --amend

Similar functionality to `rebase --interactive`, but affect only most recent commit.

  - change commit message
  - change commit author
  - add more changes
  - remove some changes

---

# Try it for yourself

This repo contains a simple library prepared in a way so you can try rebase in a safe way.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/serpent7776/git-rebase-interactive
```
```sh
git checkout exercises
```
At any point you can go back to the initial repo state by doing
```sh
git reset --hard initial
```

---

# Change commit message

`reword` command can be used to change commit message.

```sh
git rebase --interactive origin/master
```

```sh
pick 302d24d Change me
```
Change to
```sh
reword 302d24d Change me
```

Editor will be launched so that commit message can be changed.  
You can change the messege here to, e.g. "Updated catch2 to v2.13.8"

---

# Remove commits

`drop` command allows you to remove a commit that's not needed.

```sh
git rebase --interactive origin/master
```

```txt
pick 2af9f29 Unneeded commit
```

Change to

```txt
drop 2af9f29 Unneeded commit
```

---

# Reorder commits

During rebase you can freely change the order of commits.

```sh
git rebase --interactive origin/master
```

```sh
pick d708f32 Added tests for split function
pick 638c919 Added split function
```

Change to

```sh
pick 638c919 Added split function
pick d708f32 Added tests for split function
```

---

# Fixup commits

`fixup` command can be used to add fixes to already made commits.

There's test case failing, you can fix it by adding
```cpp
	if (s.empty())
	{
		return std::nullopt;
	}
```
to `atoi` function and then:
```sh
git add lib.hpp  # add changes to commit
git commit --fixup=hash_of_commit_to_fix  # create a fixup commit
git rebase --interactive --autosquash origin/master  # auto merge fixup commit
```
Note the `--autosquash` option. It's required to auto apply fixup commits.  
The original commit will be altered.

---

# Execute an external command

You can instruct git to run arbitrary command while rebasing. This can be useful for running tests while rebasing.

```sh
git rebase --interactive origin/master
```

Add this line at any place to run tests while rebasing:
```
exec make run_tests
```
If tests fail, rebase will be interrupted.
Fix the errors and run

```sh
git rebase --continue
```

---

# Split commit

Rebase can be used to split big commits into a number of smaller ones.

```sh
git rebase --interactive origin/master
```
.q[change this line] `pick 602fcf5 Initial commit`

.q[to this] `edit 602fcf5 Initial commit`
```sh
git reset HEAD~  # reset to previous commit
```
```sh
git add lib.hpp
git commit -m 'Added join function'  # create 1st commit
```
```sh
git add tests.cpp tests_main.cpp lib/catch.hpp
git commit -m 'Added tests for join'  # create 2st commit
```
```sh
git add Makefile
git commit -m 'Added Makefile'  # create 3st commit
```
```sh
git rebase --continue
```

---

# Change commit author

First, change your user data globally (or locally via `--local`)
```sh
git config --global user.name "you name"
git config --global user.email you@domain.com
```

To change author of most recent commit:
```sh
git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
```

For a range of commits:
```sh
git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit' origin/master
```

---

# Push after rebase

After any rebase, `git push` will fail. That's because it's no longer a fast-forward change (commit history has been rewritten).

```
                     A---B---C  origin/topic
                    /
               D---E---F---G  master
                            \
                             A'--B'--C'  topic
```

To push rewritten history to a remote `git push --force-with-lease` needs to be used.

There's also `git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes` for some more security.

More detailed description of the possible issue with --force-with-lease:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/65839129

A simple git alias can help:
```sh
git config --global alias.push-f 'push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes'
```
`git push-f` is now the same as `git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes`.

---

# Pulling rebased branch

You should not need this.

After pushing rebased branch to the remote, `git pull` no longer works on other machines, that are still on the older version of the branch.

```
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```

Instead either:

```sh
git pull --rebase
```

or:

```sh
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/your_branch
```

This one will remove all local changes not present in the remote (even the committed ones).

---

# Final thoughts

- `rebase --interactive` can be very useful to clean up development branch
- don't rewrite history once review has started
- don't rebase shared branches
- don't rebase on another branch and rewrite history at the same time
- keep your development branch small
- keep your commits small
- rebase conflicts can get tricky
- consider doing `git push` before rebasing
- when in doubt, ask someone for help
- every team has their own workflow, some of above points might not apply
